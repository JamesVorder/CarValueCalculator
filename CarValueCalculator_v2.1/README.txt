Only a few things have been modified by me on this one.
1: I moved some methods out of CarValueCalculator into CarValue
2: I moved your if statements into a seperate method in CarValueCalculator to make it a bit easier on the eyes
3: I apparently did something that makes everything but drJava think CarValueCalculator has no main method???

If you could look into 3 that'd be great.
